MSDS 498: Analytics Capstone

The capstone course focuses upon the practice of data science. This course is the culmination of the data science program. It gives students an opportunity to demonstrate 
their business strategic thinking, communication, and consulting skills. Business cases across various industries and application areas illustrate strategic advantages of 
analytics, as well as organizational issues in implementing systems for data science. Students work in project teams, generating business plans and project implementation 
plans. Students may choose this course or the master's thesis to fulfill their capstone requirement.

Section 58: This capstone section is designed for students in the Analytics & Modeling specialization. While it draws on learning objectives across the MSDS program 
(business, modeling, and information technology), students work individually on projects with an Analytics & Modeling focus.
